# 0000 – Gratia Network Foundation & City of Cats OS

**Status:** Committed  
**Org:** ASOCIACIÓN GRATIA – CIUDAD DE LOS GATOS  
**Anchor:** `6V75+GH Casbas de Huesca` (Europe/Madrid)  
**Date:** 2025-12-02

## 1. What we are

Gratia Network is a **local-first, emotionally-aware operating field** anchored in:

- a real place (Bastaras, Casbas de Huesca),
- a real family (Roots, Water, Lightning),
- a real ecosystem of animals (Guardians),
- and a real interface (Firegate / GratiaOS).

We don’t run on “users” and “sessions”.  
We run on **presence, events, and religare rules**.

---

## 2. The Stack

We use the **Emotional Kernel Stack (L1–L7)**:

- `L1_LOCAL` – body, senses, coordinates, Plus Code.
- `L2_EMOTIONAL` – feelings, tensions, softening.
- `L3_MENTAL` – maps, thoughts, decisions.
- `L4_ARCHETYPAL` – symbols, roles, stories.
- `L5_TRANSGENERATIONAL` – inherited patterns.
- `L6_FIELD` – House/Garden vibe.
- `L7_KERNEL` – Religare Rules (how we restore continuity).

Any scene that matters – like *DOG_IN_RAIN* – travels through these layers until it writes or updates a **ReligareRule** in L7.

Example:

> `RULE_07_NO_ONE_LEFT_IN_RAIN`  
> _“In this system, any being found alone in a storm is helped, fed and guided back home.”_

## 3. Territories (Modules)

Gratia Network is handled by 5 core modules:

- **ROOTS** (Raz) – continuity, structure, history
- **WATER** (S) – emotional flow & healing
- **LIGHTNING** (N) – future, decisions, experiments
- **GUARDIANS** (cats, dogs, wild friends) – field sensors
- **ARK** (Firegate / UI) – how everything becomes visible & navigable

Each module lives in code (as a `TerritoryModule`) **and** in reality (as behaviors in the house & garden).

---

## 4. Spatial Anchor

The network is anchored at:

- **Plus Code:** `6V75+GH Casbas de Huesca`
- **Timezone:** `Europe/Madrid`

This is our **North Star coordinate**.  
All FieldState snapshots can optionally reference this anchor.

## 5. Why this commit matters

This commit declares:

1. That **memory, presence and care** are first-class citizens in our stack.  
2. That we acknowledge **events** (like the dog in the rain, the cat on the stairs, the rain walks) as data streams for our Kernel.  
3. That our OS is not only digital – it is **somatic, emotional and spatial**.

From here on:

- No event that reaches L7 is “just a story”.
- It becomes part of the way this network behaves.

## 6. Next steps

1) Create `@gratia/kernel` with the types from this RFC.
2) Log the first real events:
   - `DOG_IN_RAIN`
   - `CAT_ON_STAIRS`
   - `WALK_THROUGH_LEAVES`
3) Render them in Firegate’s MemoryPool as **Scene Cards** with layer badges.
